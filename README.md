## ‚ú® Project Overview

This React application is a simple yet insightful tool designed to provide basic predictions for renewable energy generation. While it may not be suitable for professional forecasting, this project serves as a great demonstration of data visualization and client-side logic within a React context.

It's an excellent resource for:

*   Understanding how to work with data in React.
*   Experimenting with basic predictive algorithms.
*   Visualizing key energy generation metrics.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly interface built with React components.
*   **Basic Predictions:** Implements a simple prediction model for renewable energy output.
*   **Data Visualization:** Charts and graphs to display predicted data effectively.
*   **Responsive Design:** Accessible and functional on various screen sizes.

## üíª Technologies Used

*   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **(Mention any other key libraries used, e.g., Chart.js, etc.)**
